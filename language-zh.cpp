// Nouns.

// For each noun in English, provide:

// 1) the type (usually gender) of the noun. For example, in Polish each noun can be:

// masculine living (GEN_M),
// masculine object (GEN_O),
// feminine (GEN_F), or
// neuter (GEN_N).

// 2) all the forms required by HyperRogue. For example, in Polish the following are
// given:
// The following forms are given:
// nominative (referred to as %1),
// nominative plural (%P1),
// accusative (%a1),
// ablative (%abl1) (for land names, locative "in/on..." is given instead of ablative).

// Feel free to add more or less forms or types if needed. Note that you don't
// have to provide all the forms in your language, only those used by HyperRogue
// (in Polish just 4 of 14 forms are used, and this is probably similar in other
// languages).
